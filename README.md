# A simple web redirect to allow users to open links in-app

# Sample Usage

When a user creates an account, an email is sent which redirects to the link below
https://lemeow125.github.io/simple-redirect/#/redirect/stude/activation/MUID/12asdSDFGSDTSDFG

The link above when clicked will open the "activation" page/screen of our mobile app, pass the UID slug value of "MUID" and activation slug value of "12asdSDFGSDTSDFG"

Do not change the redirect keyword
"stude" in the example above must correspond to the name of your mobile app
"activation" should correspond to the link to your mobile app's screen/page
you can adjust the last two URL slugs/values accordingly
