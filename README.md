# A simple web redirect to allow users to open links in-app

To use the deployed app,

# Sample Usage

Have your activation email redirect a link like below
https://lemeow125.github.io/simple-redirect/#/stude/activation/MUID/12asdSDFGSDTSDFG

This will open the "activation" page/screen of our mobile app, pass the UID slug value of "MUID" and activation slug value of "12asdSDFGSDTSDFG
"

"stude" in the example above must correspond to the name of your mobile app
